# **Stabilize circadian rhythm**

## Intro

### **Text**
[//]: <> (BO-text)

We all have a 24-hour cycle in our body that regulates a lot of our behaviour and processes. This cycle is also called the circadian rhythm. It makes sense that since a day lasts 24 hours, that this cycle within us also lasts approximately 24 hours (1). Our body and cells in general prefer a certain degree of stability. Balancing stability with __Intermittant living__ (link) especially has a lot of advantages (source). This natural tendency for our body to create a balance is also called homeostasis.

## Why
[//]: <> (BO-why)

### Benefit 1

Sleep is one of the factors that influence our body and circadian rhythm. Our body enjoys a stable circadian rhythm to improve health and overall well-being (2).

### Benefit 2

Stabilizing your circadian rhythm and sleep pattern on average leads to higher academic performance (3).

### Benefit 3

For women, the menstrual cycle is more regular and lasts shorter with a stable circadian rhythm (4). There is also a growing body of evidence that an irregular circadian rhythm increases the chance of breast cancer (4). For pregnant women, having a stable 24-hour cycle improves the physiology of the mother, placenta and fetus (5).

### Benefit 4

A more regular circadian rhythm also might help improve mental health conditions such as bipolar disorder (6).

## How
[//]: <> (BO-how)

### Instruction 1

In order to stabilize your biological 24-hour cycle, it is best to go to bed at around the same time every day. Try to do this consistently. We understand that this will not be always possible, but you do yourself a favour by trying to make it as stable as possible. If you can stabilize either your time going to bed or waking up, go for it. You can find more information on how to achieve this under the tactic __Fixed sleeping time__ (link) and __Consistent wake time__ (link). At some point you will notice that you will automatically get tired and wake up at the same time every day.
