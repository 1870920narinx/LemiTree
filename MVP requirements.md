        - General disclaimer and important notes before using this most amazing library

            The purpose of this database is to support you in your unique life's journey.

            We provide you with hands on tools and strategies to live a rich life that is worth living.

            Before we get started we have some important disclaimers:

            !! Only use this database if you are willing to take responsibility and reflect on your situation !!

            → You have the most information about your unique life

            → You are therefore in the best possible position to take responsibility for your life

            If you can answer the following 2 questions you can already get started with living in upwards cycle:

            1) What are some things I'm doing, that I know I shouldn't be doing but am doing anyways?

            2) What are some things that I'm not doing, that I know I should be doing but keep on pulling off?

            Choose one of the 1st list to decrease or minimize doing.

            Also choose one of the 2nd list to do more off.

            As long as you continuously work on this process, you will be going for an upward spiral.

            Then see if you can get some inspiration in this library to help you in the process.

            As you will notice, there are many tactics to try.

            Therefore just experiment with the ones you find interesting.

            (Productivity wise, we especially recommend the one-timers!)

            As with everything, try the 80/20 principle to reach more impact with less effort.

            This implies with 20% of the effort getting to 80% of the results.

            One example is to mostly eat properly during the week and let yourself eat what you feel like for the weekend.

            Eating proper can definitely be very tasty.

            Therefore find a weekly rhythm that costs little energy, is very health and tastes great to you!

            If you want our most highly recommended start of this library, go here.

            There you will a high quality course on getting to know yourself.

            Your life is absolutely unique and for you.

            Getting to know your unique Self will therefore benefit you your entire life.

            This is what 'doing the right things' is all about.

            One last point!

            Above all, enjoy yourself and allow the child in you to play around with this information :D
