## - Why this information hub?

  We as founders have been extremely lucky in the lottery of life. We were born with very good chances. Life is unfair since not everyone is this lucky. This is why we wish to share our fortune with everyone, including you. With this library of most valuable actions, we wish to increase the chances of all of us to fulfil our dreams and purpose.

  Second, humanity has so much to offer. Many people and ancestors have/had great intentions, ideas and created amazing inventions. The internet has enabled us to share these amazing fruits of humanity with everyone who is connected. After 25 years of internet, a problem emerged which we wish to solve. All this valuable, amazing information is spread all across the internet. We wish to bring this all together. This way, you can immediately start experimenting, improving and reach for the stars.

  We can not do this alone though. If you would like to help us help everyone, please go *here*

## - How to use this information hub?

  Some of were born lucky, some of us weren't. Still, what holds for all of us is that we have to work to make it work for us. So use it, do it, act. Experience to see what works for you. Step 1 = information, step 2 = experiment and grow, step 3 = share.

        Before we get started we have some important disclaimers:

        !! Only use this database if you are willing to take responsibility and reflect on your situation !!

        → You have the most information about your unique life

        → You are therefore in the best possible position to take responsibility for your life

        If you can answer the following 2 questions you can already get started with living in upwards cycle:

        1) What are some things I'm doing, that I know I shouldn't be doing but am doing anyways?

        2) What are some things that I'm not doing, that I know I should be doing but keep on pulling off?

        Choose one of the 1st list to decrease or minimize doing.

        Also choose one of the 2nd list to do more off.

        As long as you continuously work on this process, you will be going for an upward spiral.

        Then see if you can get some inspiration in this library to help you in the process.

        As you will notice, there are many tactics to try.

        Therefore just experiment with the ones you find interesting.

        (Productivity wise, we especially recommend the one-timers!)

        As with everything, try the 80/20 principle to reach more impact with less effort.

        This implies with 20% of the effort getting to 80% of the results.

        One example is to mostly eat properly during the week and let yourself eat what you feel like for the weekend.

        Eating proper can definitely be very tasty.

        Therefore find a weekly rhythm that costs little energy, is very health and tastes great to you!
