## - What is this information hub?

  This platform collects the most valuable actions humanity is aware off to help you have more impact with less effort. We wish to support you as much as we can to fuel and fulfil your dreams and purpose.

## - Why this information hub?

  The main purpose of this information hub is to give you actionable tools that create more freedom and time in your life. Side-effects include better health, finances, purpose and relationships with your loved ones.

  Humanity has so much to offer. Many people and ancestors have/had great intentions, ideas and created amazing inventions. The internet has enabled us to share these amazing fruits of humanity with everyone who is connected. After 25 years of internet, a problem emerged which we wish to solve. All this valuable, amazing information is spread all across the internet. We wish to bring this all together. This way, you can immediately start experimenting, improving and reach for the stars.

  We can not do this alone though. If you would like to help us help everyone, please go *here*

## - How to use this information hub?

  Some of were born lucky, some of us weren't. Still, what holds for all of us is that we have to work to make it work for us. So use it, do it, act. Experience to see what works for you. In general, these two questions will help you become self-directed in your growth:

  1) What is one of these things that I do, that I know I shouldn't be doing, but I keep on doing anyways?

  2) What is one of these things that I know I should be doing, but I keep on procrastinating on?

  Now, start with the worst of the answers of question 1 that you would be willing to do something about. Do the same for question 2. If you remove the worst and add the best, you will automatically start an upward spiral. Now all that's left is the following:

  Step 1 = actionable information

  Step 2 = experiment, learn & grow

  Step 3 = share

  As you will notice, there are many tactics to try. Therefore just experiment with the ones you find interesting.
