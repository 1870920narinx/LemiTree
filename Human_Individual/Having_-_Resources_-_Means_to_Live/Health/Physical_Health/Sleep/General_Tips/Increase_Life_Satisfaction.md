One of the crucial aspects about life satisfaction is setting up our life in such a way that it resonates with who we truly are and would love to be. One of the most constructive ways to redirect our life, is to start a very honest conversation with ourselves. Dare to observe what we are fearful off and confront these issues voluntarily. Our greatest steps forward often lie in confronting, overcoming, and tackling the challenges we would rather ignore. Carrying out this honest self forward and speaking out truthfully to our environment will also remove a lot of the frictions and frustrations that might have evolved over our life.  Two other great ways to increasing our life satisfaction are to learning [mindfulness]() and [practicing gratitude]().
